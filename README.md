## Description
 

These are some code pieces of my undergraduation research 
on breadth-first search in parrallel.


## Organization 

The project consists of three parts:

1. A naive implementation of bfs in C language. (The algorithm is from CLRS)
2. Several parrallel versions for Multi-core platform implemented in OpenMP. 
3. Serveral parrallel versions for Many-core platform implemented in NVIDIA CUDA.

They are all tested on computer with 4-sockets CPUs (each one has 8 cores). 

## About the Test Cases

They are tested on Tesla 2050 GPU.

The test cases are from following 4 sets:
1. real graphs from DIAMCS
2. regular graphs
3. irregular graph
4. R-MAT graphs
